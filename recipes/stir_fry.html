    <h2>A <em>tasty</em> stir fry for lunch</h2>

    <p>A standard Asian stir fry tailored to a vegan palate. But don't let that scare you!</p>

    <p>The awesome thing about stir fries are that you can easily change out ingredients to
        make it your own without messing it up. I like to get <em>spicy</em> with it but
        adjust to your level of tolerance.</p>

    <p>This recipe will make six individual meals. I meal prep everything in one go so that I have lunches ready for
        cooking. </p>
